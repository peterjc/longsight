Hobby project to try out webcam image capture using Python,
with a view to astrophotography. Initial aims included doing
image capture under Mac OS X with control of exposure, gain,
white balance etc. That turns out to be problematic due to
driver issues.

Currently looking at integrating an I2C orientation sensor
via a Raspberry Pi to mimic a computerised "Goto" telescope
mount using the Meade LX200 protocol, in order to track where
a telescope is pointing via client software like Sky Safari:

Potential medium/long term ambitions may
include doing image alignment/registration and stacking -
combining multiple frames to maximum light collection and
cancel out noise, but also stiching images together (e.g.
for lunar photography) using techniques similar to those for
constructing panoramas.
